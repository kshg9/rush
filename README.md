## Shell implementation in Rust

Credits and motivation:

- [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)
- [rustyline](https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline)

### Development Roadmap

[x] Basic command execution

[x] Built-in command handlers

[x] Basic pipe support (eg: `ls -la | grep .rs`)

[x] Argument parsing for quoted strings (eg: `ls -la | grep ".rs"`)

[-] Input/Output redirection (`>` and `>>`) 🥲

### Objective
